    """
    Walk a type's mro from back to front and merge or retrieve a _deep copy_ of a class attribute.
    Mergable attribute types (including subtypes) are, lists, dictionaries, and sets. Attributes are
    deep copied to avoid modifying class attributes inplace.

    Nested attribute retrieval is supported by providing the attribute to retrieve separated by `.`
    (i.e. to get `Foo.bar.baz`, `merge_class_attr(Foo, "bar.baz")`).

    Collection type class attributes that are explicitly empty and a type or subtype of the
    accumulated merge object, are not merged. Instead, the accumulated merge object is set to a copy
    of the empty collection for the next iteration.

    Raises
    ------
    AttributeError
        Raises if default not provided and no attribute does not exist

    # for example, a class `Foo` has a *class variable* `bar` with the value `[1, 2, 3]`.
    # a subclass `Baz(Foo)` is defined and does not specify a value for `bar`
    # (i.e. `class Baz(Foo): ...`). this means, `Baz` contains a reference to `Foo`'s `bar`
    # *class variable*. thus, `id(Foo.bar) == id(Baz.bar)`. consequently, if we do not keep track of
    # `Foo`'s `bar` id (think of this like `&Foo.baz`), when merging `Baz`'s `bar`, we could
